# Macro Tracker

A Kotlin-based Android app designed to track personal macros throughout the day.

## Project Overview

Macro Tracker was created to help users monitor their nutritional intake, focusing specifically on macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats). The application provides an intuitive interface for logging meals and visualizing daily progress.

## Features

- **Food Logging**: Quick entry of meals with macro information
- **Progress Visualization**: Charts and graphs showing daily and weekly trends
- **Goal Setting**: Personalized macro goals based on user preferences
- **Meal Presets**: Save common meals for quick logging

## Technical Implementation

The app was developed using Kotlin and follows modern Android architecture principles:

- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of UI and business logic
- **Room Database**: Local storage for user data
- **Android Jetpack**: Leveraging modern Android development tools
- **Material Design**: Following Google's design guidelines for a polished UI

## Learning Experience

This project provided hands-on experience with Android development best practices and working with real-time data visualization. It improved my understanding of mobile UI/UX design principles and persistent local storage.

## Future Improvements

- Barcode scanning for automatic food entry
- Integration with fitness tracking apps
- Social features for sharing progress
- Cloud synchronization across devices
