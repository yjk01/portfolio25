# Cramvas

A simple web interface designed to help students study using quizzes from Canvas.

## Project Overview

2. A user-friendly interface for quiz navigation
3. Local storage for saving progress between sessions

## Future Plans

- Mobile app version
- Collaborative study features
- Integration with additional learning management systems
