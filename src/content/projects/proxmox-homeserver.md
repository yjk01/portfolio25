# Proxmox Homeserver

A self-hosted home server setup using Proxmox VE to practice system administration fundamentals and host various applications.

## Overview

This project involves setting up a home server using Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) as the hypervisor. The server hosts multiple virtual machines and containers to provide various services for personal use and learning.

## Technologies Used

- **Proxmox VE**: Hypervisor platform
- **Linux**: Various distributions for VMs and containers
- **Docker**: Container management
- **Networking**: VLAN configuration, routing, and firewall setup

## Key Features

- **Virtualization**: Running multiple isolated virtual machines
- **Containerization**: LXC containers for lightweight service hosting
- **Resource Management**: CPU, memory, and storage allocation
- **Backup System**: Automated snapshots and backups
- **Monitoring**: System metrics and alerts

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

1. Server hardware selection and configuration
2. Network architecture design for home infrastructure
3. Linux system administration and troubleshooting
4. Security hardening and best practices
5. Disaster recovery planning and implementation

## Future Improvements

- Implement more advanced networking configurations
- Set up a more robust backup solution
- Explore clustering and high availability options
