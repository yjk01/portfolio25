# IT Services AI Chatbot

A Microsoft Copilot Studio-based AI chatbot designed to support IT services, with integrations for ticketing systems and knowledge bases.

## Project Background

During my internship at Kodiak Building Partners, I was tasked with developing an IT support chatbot that could handle common questions, troubleshoot basic issues, and create support tickets when necessary.

## Implementation Details

The chatbot was built using Microsoft Copilot Studio and integrated with several key systems:

- **Azure Active Directory**: For user authentication and personalization
- **Jira API**: For creating and tracking IT support tickets
- **Power Automate**: For workflow automation and system integrations
- **SharePoint**: For accessing knowledge base articles and documentation

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and responding to user queries in natural language
- **Ticket Creation**: Automatically creating Jira tickets based on conversation context
- **Knowledge Base Access**: Retrieving relevant documentation to assist users
- **Escalation Logic**: Knowing when to involve human IT staff
- **User Authentication**: Secure access to personalized information

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was integrating the disparate systems while maintaining a seamless user experience. This required:

1. Creating custom API connectors for Jira
2. Developing authentication flows that were secure yet user-friendly
3. Implementing conversation flows that felt natural while gathering necessary information

## Results

The chatbot successfully reduced the volume of basic support requests handled by the IT team, allowing them to focus on more complex issues. User feedback was positive, particularly regarding the quick response times and 24/7 availability.

## Technical Documentation

Comprehensive documentation was created to ensure the chatbot could be maintained and extended by the IT team after my internship concluded.
